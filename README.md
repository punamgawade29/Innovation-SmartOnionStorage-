Team Agrov Innovators, comprising with 7 members  group of third-year students and amdocs company employee. With a background in agriculture, we joined the Astrothon competition hosted by Amdocs company..

Recognizing the prevalent issue of onion wastage and the need to enhance storage efficiency, we decided to tackle the problem of improving onion storage design. In India, where approximately 65% of onion production hits the market between April and May, up to 40% of the crop is lost during storage, leading to significant price fluctuations.

Existing solutions like Tata Steel and smart cold storage have proven insufficient in maintaining onion quality. To address this, we propose a smart onion storage solution integrating IoT technology. Our cost-effective foldable storage box structure is equipped with sensors to monitor temperature, humidity, and gas levels, while fans regulate conditions to prevent spoilage.

Key features of our project include IoT-based remote monitoring, a cost-effective design to minimize losses, and a networked system for onion crop management. Through these innovations, we aim to increase the shelf life of stored onions and reduce wastage significantly.

# What are the new solution 
We create a cost-effective foldable storage box  like structure for onion storage using IOT based Technology & some Fertilizers/ insecticides spraying to protect onions from diseases.

1) Reduce wastage
2) Maintain quality
3) Cost-effective- maintain price flucuation.
4) Minimum weight loss of onion
